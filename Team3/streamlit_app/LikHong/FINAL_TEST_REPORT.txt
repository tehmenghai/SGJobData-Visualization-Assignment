================================================================================

"This dashboard transformed my job search. The radar chart helped me understand
not just which jobs pay well, but which ones I actually have the best chance of
getting. The match score breakdown is genius - I can see why a job is a 95% 
match versus 70%.

The competition filter saved me hours by filtering out positions with 500+ 
applicants. Everything loaded fast, and I never felt lost or confused.

Overall: 9.5/10 - Would definitely recommend to other jobseekers!"
